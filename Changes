Revision history for B-Hooks-EndOfScope

0.13      2014-01-07 21:17:39Z
  - Variable::Magic added as a runtime recommendation for greater visibility
    (RT#89245)
  - fixed broken logic in compiler detection on older perls
  - fixed inaccurate repository metadata

0.12   2012-12-04 20:13:00Z
  - Complete pure-perl implementation in addition to the one based on
    Variable::Magic. You can specify the implementation explicitly by
    use-ing B::Hooks::EndOfScope::PP or B::Hooks::EndOfScope::XS, or
    by setting $ENV{B_HOOKS_ENDOFSCOPE_IMPLEMENTATION} to either 'XS'
    or 'PP'
  - Switch from using Sub::Exporter to the more conservative
    Sub::Exporter::Progressive

0.11   2012-02-23 10:19:18Z
  - A minor efficiency improvement.

0.10   2012-02-16 08:41:54Z
  - Stop propagating our magic through localisation.

0.09   2010-05-07 20:11:49Z
  - Improve distribution metadata.

0.08   2009-04-19 17:15:44Z
  - Depend on Variable::Magic 0.34 so exceptions during compile time that
    trigger a destructor don't cause an exception on 5.10 anymore.

0.07   2009-02-20 13:22:16Z
  - Depend on Variable::Magic 0.31 so exceptions thrown in on_scope_end
    blocks don't lose their error message.

0.06   2009-01-18 23:51:45Z
  - Depend on Variable::Magic 0.27 to stop exceptions thrown in
    on_scope_end blocks from segfaulting. Also add a test for that.

0.05   2009-01-04 19:46:07Z
  - Use Variable::Magic and cast %^H instead Scope::Guard and relying
    on a timely destruction of objects within %^H. This fixes using
    on_scope_end in blocks where string evals are compiled as those
    increment the refcount of objects in %^H on 5.10.

0.04   2008-10-20 10:56:23Z
  - Remove an unused bit from the $^H mask.

0.03   2008-10-20 04:53:20Z
  - Improve testing of multiple hooks.
  - More documentation.
  - Require perl 5.8.0.

0.02   2008-10-19 08:25:15Z
  - Specify all dependencies.

0.01   2008-10-19 07:29:13Z
  - Initial release.
